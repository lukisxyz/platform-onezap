{"id":"onezapman-platform-0v6","title":"Setup API Structure with TanStack Query","description":"## Objective\n\nEstablish a flat API route structure with TanStack Query integration for the OneZap platform, following the architecture decisions outlined in ADR 0001 and guidelines in the knowledge base.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### 1. API Route Structure\n- Create flat API route structure (NO nested folders in routes/)\n- Use pattern-based naming convention:\n  - \n  - \n  - \n  - \n  - \n\n### 2. Endpoints to Implement\n**Content CRUD API Endpoints:**\n-  - List all content\n-  - Get content by ID\n-  - Create new content\n-  - Update existing content\n-  - Delete content\n\n**Session/Auth Check Endpoints:**\n-  - Get current session\n-  - Check authentication status\n-  - Get current user information\n\n### 3. TanStack Query Integration\n- ALL API calls must use TanStack Query\n- Implement query hooks pattern for all endpoints\n- Create dedicated API folder structure\n- Organize by feature/domain\n\n### 4. API Folder Structure\n\n\n### 5. Query Hooks Pattern\nEach API file should export:\n- Query hook (for GET requests)\n- Mutation hooks (for POST/PUT/DELETE)\n- Use types from better-auth for session handling\n- Follow TanStack Query best practices from LLM docs\n\n## References\n- Knowledge Base:  (TanStack LLM docs)\n- Architecture: \n\n## Implementation Notes\n- Follow the flat route structure strictly - no nesting\n- Use TanStack Query for ALL API interactions\n- Implement proper error handling and caching\n- Ensure type safety throughout\n- Create reusable hooks for common operations","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"fahmilukis04@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-15T13:00:53.479184269+07:00","created_by":"Fahmi","updated_at":"2026-01-15T13:00:53.479184269+07:00","labels":[" architecture"," tanstack-query","api"]}
